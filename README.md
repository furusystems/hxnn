# hxstd [![Build Status](https://ci.rackster.ch/buildStatus/icon?job=hxstd)](https://ci.rackster.ch/job/hxstd/)

> A completing yet alternative standard library for Haxe.

## Compilation Flags

`-D HXSTD_DEBUG` which enables debug mode. Setting this flag will tell the `Exceptions` to include full Call- and ExceptionStack information. Though this can be helpful during development, it should not be enabled for production/releases as the operations are expensive.

`-D HXSTD_INLINE` which will inline various helper methods such as `isEmpty()` etc. Enabling this _may_ increase performance but prevent you from overriding those methods in subclasses.

`-D HXSTD_WIN` which will tell the library that we are compiling on a Windows system. This flag is used in `hxstdm.vm.Lock` class, as `SemaphoreSlim` doesn't work on non-Windows environments.
